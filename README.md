# Compute Shader Geometry Ray Tracing
WIP. Working on a raytrace engine to raytrace meshes. Implemented using HLSL compute shaders in Unity3D.

**Currently implemented:**
- Raytracing for opaque planes and spheres.
- Specular reflections.

**To do:**
- Raytracing for meshes.
- Non-opaque materials.
- Diffuse reflections.
- Lighting.
